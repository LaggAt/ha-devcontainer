change copy_root/* to your scripts

# run HA
/usr/local/bin/hass --config /config --ignore-os-check --verbose

# scripts
## see available scripts here: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/tree/dev/homeassistant/scripts
/usr/local/bin/hass --config /config --script 



## so we could start hass and get it's process ID
/usr/local/bin/hass --config /config --ignore-os-check --verbose
echo $!
