This is a container to develop a HACS/HASS integration. It features:

* Develop on a Remote Raspberry Pi4 (therefore developing with full debugging functionality in the same environment the integration will later probably run on)
* Bluetooth / BLE is working as in the live Home Assistant container
* Live and Test system may be on the same system, and are separated (Test system uses TCP port 9123)
* Home Assistant, HACS and some useful Extensions preinstalled
* black, pytest, ...
