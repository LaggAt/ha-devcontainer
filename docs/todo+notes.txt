TODO/Notes for ha-container

# reduce size of each layer!
# add 'ha' cli tool, which is able to control HA-API:
    ha authentication reset --username "JohnDoe" --password "123SuperSecret!"
# 'ha' is called in /usr/bin/ha on the host, we could call hassio_cli ha inside our devcontainer:
  --> docker exec hassio_cli ha $*
